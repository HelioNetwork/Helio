  <https://github.com/helio-project/helio/releases>

This is a new major version release, including various bug fixes and
performance improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/helio-project/helio/issues>

Mandatory Update
==============

Helio Coin v3.0.0 is a mandatory update for all users. This release contains new consensus rules and improvements that are not backwards compatible with older versions. Users will have a grace period of one week to update their clients before enforcement of this update is enabled.

Users updating from a previous version after the 13th of October will require a full resync of their local blockchain from either the P2P network or by way of the bootstrap.

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Helio_Coin-Qt (on Mac) or heliod/helio-qt (on Linux).

Compatibility
==============

Helio Coin is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),
No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you
can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues.
Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Helio Coin should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.

### :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation: MacOS 10.13 High Sierra :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation:

**Currently there are issues with the 3.0.0 gitian release on MacOS version 10.13 (High Sierra), no reports of issues on older versions of MacOS.**


Notable Changes
===============

Zerocoin (zHLO) Protocol
---------------------

At long last, the zHLO release is here and the zerocoin protocol has been fully implemented! This allows users to send transactions with 100% fungible coins and absolutely zero history or link-ability to their previous owners.

The Zerocoin protocol allows user to convert (mint) their *HLO* to zerocoins, which we call *zHLO*. When zHLO are converted back to HLO there is no trail associated with the coins being sent, such as who originally minted those coins. Essentially the only thing the receiver of the zHLO transaction will see is that it came from the zerocoin protocol.

### zHLO Denominations
zHLO comes in specific denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000. A denomination is a similar concept to paper currency, where you can hold a $100 bill but there is no available $99 bill for you to hold.

Other implementations of the zerocoin protocol only allow for spending of one denomination/zerocoin at a time. The Helio_Coin implementation of zerocoin allows users to spend any amount of zHLO they would like (with certain limitations). If a user held two denominations of 5 and they send 7.75 to a merchant, the wallet will automatically grab the two denominations of 5 and then issue 2.25 HLO in change to the spender. There is currently a limit of up to 6 individual zerocoin `coins` that can be combined into a spend, where each `coin` could be a different or similar denomination

The Helio_Coin zerocoin implementation is structured in such a way that denominations aren't needed to be known by the average user.


Tor Service Integration Improvements
---------------------

Integrating with Tor is now easier than ever! Starting with Tor version 0.2.7.1 it is possible, through Tor's control socket API, to create and destroy 'ephemeral' hidden services programmatically. Helio Coin has been updated to make use of this.

This means that if Tor is running (and proper authorization is available), Helio Coin automatically creates a hidden service to listen on, without manual configuration. Helio Coin will also use Tor automatically to connect to other .onion nodes if the control socket can be successfully opened. This will positively affect the number of available .onion nodes and their usage.

This new feature is enabled by default if Helio Coin is listening, and a connection to Tor can be made. It can be configured with the `-listenonion`, `-torcontrol` and `-torpassword` settings. To show verbose debugging information, pass `-debug=tor`.
